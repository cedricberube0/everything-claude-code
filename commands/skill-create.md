# /skill-create - Local Skill Generation

Analyze your repository's git history to extract coding patterns and generate SKILL.md files that teach Claude your team's practices.

## Usage

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --commits 100      # Analyze last 100 commits
/skill-create --output ./skills  # Custom output directory
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning-v2
```

## What It Does

1. **Parses Git History** - Analyzes commits, file changes, and patterns
2. **Detects Patterns** - Identifies recurring workflows and conventions
3. **Generates SKILL.md** - Creates valid Claude Code skill files
4. **Optionally Creates Instincts** - For the continuous-learning-v2 system

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Gather Git Data

```bash
# Get recent commits with file changes
git log --oneline -n ${COMMITS:-200} --name-only --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%ad" --date=short

# Get commit frequency by file
git log --oneline -n 200 --name-only | grep -v "^$" | grep -v "^[a-f0-9]" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Get commit message patterns
git log --oneline -n 200 | cut -d' ' -f2- | head -50
```

### Step 2: Detect Patterns

Look for these pattern types:

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Commit conventions** | Regex on commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:) |
| **File co-changes** | Files that always change together |
| **Workflow sequences** | Repeated file change patterns |
| **Architecture** | Folder structure and naming conventions |
| **Testing patterns** | Test file locations, naming, coverage |

### Step 3: Generate SKILL.md

**Output path — directory format is mandatory**: write to
`<output-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, defaulting to
`.claude/skills/{repo-name}-patterns/SKILL.md` for a project skill (or
`~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` for a global one). Claude Code only
auto-discovers skills at `<name>/SKILL.md` with parseable frontmatter; a flat
`<name>.md` (or anything dropped into a `learned/` archive directory) is
**inert** — never scanned, matched, or loaded.

Output format:

```markdown
---
name: {repo-name}-patterns
description: Use when starting a coding session in {repo-name}, or before naming a branch, writing a commit message, placing a test file, or running closeout — conventions and co-change pairs measured from git history
version: 1.0.0
source: local-git-analysis
analyzed_commits: {count}
---

# {Repo Name} Patterns

## Commit Conventions
{detected commit message patterns}

## Code Architecture
{detected folder structure and organization}

## Workflows
{detected repeating file change patterns}

## Testing Patterns
{detected test conventions}
```

**Description rules (the `description` is the ONLY discovery surface):**

- At session start Claude scans only `name` + `description` and loads the body
  on a match — the description must name the *when*, not just the *what*.
- Lead with "Use when ..." followed by concrete, observable trigger moments
  (session start in this repo, naming a branch, writing a commit, placing a
  test file, editing hot modules, running closeout).
- Up to 1024 chars are allowed; spend them on triggers, not summary prose.
  "Coding patterns extracted from X" matches almost nothing.
- `name` must equal the skill's directory name exactly.

**Verify discoverability after writing** (do not skip):

```bash
ls <output-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md          # path shape is <name>/SKILL.md
head -8 <output-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md      # starts with ---, has name: + description:
```

### Step 4: Generate Instincts (if --instincts)

For continuous-learning-v2 integration:

```yaml
---
id: {repo}-commit-convention
trigger: "when writing a commit message"
confidence: 0.8
domain: git
source: local-repo-analysis
---

# Use Conventional Commits

## Action
Prefix commits with: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, test:, refactor:

## Evidence
- Analyzed {n} commits
- {percentage}% follow conventional commit format
```

## Example Output

Running `/skill-create` on a TypeScript project might produce `.claude/skills/my-app-patterns/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-app-patterns
description: Use when starting a coding session in my-app, or before naming a branch, writing a commit message, adding a component, or placing a test file — conventions measured from 150 commits of git history
version: 1.0.0
source: local-git-analysis
analyzed_commits: 150
---

# My App Patterns

## Commit Conventions

This project uses **conventional commits**:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs:` - Documentation updates

## Code Architecture

```
src/
├── components/     # React components (PascalCase.tsx)
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (use*.ts)
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
└── services/       # API and external services
```

## Workflows

### Adding a New Component
1. Create `src/components/ComponentName.tsx`
2. Add tests in `src/components/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx`
3. Export from `src/components/index.ts`

### Database Migration
1. Modify `src/db/schema.ts`
2. Run `pnpm db:generate`
3. Run `pnpm db:migrate`

## Testing Patterns

- Test files: `__tests__/` directories or `.test.ts` suffix
- Coverage target: 80%+
- Framework: Vitest
```

## GitHub App Integration

For advanced features (10k+ commits, team sharing, auto-PRs), use the [Skill Creator GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator):

- Install: [github.com/apps/skill-creator](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator)
- Comment `/skill-creator analyze` on any issue
- Receives PR with generated skills

## Related Commands

- `/instinct-import` - Import generated instincts
- `/instinct-status` - View learned instincts
- `/evolve` - Cluster instincts into skills/agents
